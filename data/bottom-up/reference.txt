<t> this is the third part of our major good health series on dementia . </t> <t> we look at ways to help minimise the impact of memory problems . </t> <t> for example , we need just as much sleep as we get older . </t> <t> the problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep . </t> <t> when the short-term memory starts to go , it can make it hard for someone to recall what they have already done that day , such as whether they 've had breakfast , or showered , or spoken to someone . </t> <t> it can help to keep a diary - a record of what has been done through the day . writing also helps encourage the cognitive processes , which can help slow down future decline . </t> <t> create a memory hub - that is , a central place in the home , perhaps the dining room table or a desk , where important notes , car keys , house keys and drugs that need to be taken are kept . put things here that you want to be able to find quickly . get into the habit of having everything in this one place rather than having things scattered about the home . </t> <t> get a whiteboard or blackboard - that can be used to record a timetable of what needs to be done each day that week . things that get done can be ticked off . it is another way to show what has been done , but also shows what remains to be done . </t> <t> label doors , drawers , cupboards and cabinets to avoid confusion about what goes where . </t> <t> have a list of the numbers of key people by the phone - your gp and other care professionals , carers , family and reliable friends . </t> <t> have a daily newspaper delivered - it is a simple way of keeping aware of what is happening in the world and is a useful reminder of that day 's date . </t> <t> when showering or having a bath , establish a routine as a reminder of whether your hair has been washed . for example , move the conditioner and shampoo from one side of the bath to the other once you 've used them . </t> <t> eat regular meals . while other body cells can take fuel from elsewhere , the brain relies on a good supply of glucose from the blood . that 's why skipping a meal can affect reasoning , cognition and memory . </t> <t> in the early stages of dementia , begin a reminiscence book to act as a reminder of key events in that person 's life and who people are . it 's a nice thing for the person with dementia and a loved one to do together . include pictures and snippets of information and date and label every entry . </t>
