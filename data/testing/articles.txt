washington ( cnn ) president barack obama says he is `` absolutely committed to making sure '' israel maintains a military advantage over iran . his comments to the new york times , published on sunday , come amid criticism from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu of the deal that the united states and five other world powers struck with iran . tehran agreed to halt the country 's nuclear ambitions , and in exchange , western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the iran 's economy . obama said he understands and respects netanyahu 's stance that israel is particularly vulnerable and does n't `` have the luxury of testing these propositions '' in the deal . `` but what i would say to them is that not only am i absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge , and that they can deter any potential future attacks , but what i 'm willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood , including iran , a clarity that if israel were to be attacked by any state , that we would stand by them , '' obama said . that , he said , should be `` sufficient to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table , '' he said . the framework negotiators announced last week would see iran reduce its centrifuges from 19,000 to 5,060 , limit the extent to which uranium necessary for nuclear weapons can be enriched and increase inspections . the talks over a final draft are scheduled to continue until june 30 . but netanyahu and republican critics in congress have complained that iran wo n't have to shut down its nuclear facilities and that the country 's leadership is n't trustworthy enough for the inspections to be as valuable as obama says they are . obama said even if iran ca n't be trusted , there 's still a case to be made for the deal . `` in fact , you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us , all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know what they 're doing and that , for a long period of time , we can prevent them from having a nuclear weapon , '' obama said .
( cnn ) the american pharmacists association is discouraging its members from participating in executions . on monday , the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy , stating that `` such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers . '' this bolsters the association 's previous positions to oppose the use of the term `` drug '' for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases . the group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection , said michelle spinnler , spokeswoman for the american pharmacists association . that spotlight includes a january supreme court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in oklahoma . this was prompted by clayton lockett 's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack . in georgia last month , the execution of female death row inmate kelly renee gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy . thirty-two sates allow capital punishment , and lethal injection is still the most common method . last month , utah gov . gary r. herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available . of the eight inmates currently on death row in utah , three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad . pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection . in texas , the department of criminal justice told cnn in march they are running out of their supply . in july 2011 , lundbeck inc. , the manufacturer of pentobarbital , decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment . the companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose , so states then turned to compounded preparations , spinnler said . `` pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way . '' she says . the new declaration by the american pharmacists association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the american medical association , the american nurses association and the american board of anesthesiology .

'' the foreign office also blamed what it said was india 's delay in cooperating in the case , saying it `` weakened the prosecution . '' in the mumbai attacks , heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around mumbai , including luxury hotels , the city 's historic victoria terminus train station and a jewish cultural center . india executed the last surviving gunman from the attacks in 2012 . other suspects were all killed during the series of attacks , which went on for three days . more about the mumbai attacks . cnn 's harmeet singh contributed to this report .
